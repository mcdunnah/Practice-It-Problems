/* Assume that you have a variable called count that will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. 
You are going to formulate expressions in terms of count that will yield different sequences. 
The first row is filled in for you as an example. Fill in the solution boxes below, indicating an expression that will generate each sequence. 
Your answers should be in the form 'coefficient * count + constant' in that order, or the solution checking may not be accurate.

/* Solution:
A) Find the difference between the first 2 numbers of each sequence. The difference is the coefficient. 
  Example: In problem 1, the difference betweeen 4 and 19 is 15. This difference stays consistent with the rest of the sequence. Therefore the coefficient is 15.
B) Multiply the count by the coefficient. Then find the difference between the calculated number and the first number of the sequence. The difference is the constant.
  Example: In problem 1, coefficient * count is 15 and the 1st number of the sequence is 4. The difference from 15 to 4 is -11 therefore -11 is the constant.

Note: If the sequence is decreasing, the coefficient is negative.

*/

// Problem 1
15 * count - 11

// Problem 2
-10 * count + 40

// Problem 3
4 * count - 11

// Problem 4
-3 * count + 100
